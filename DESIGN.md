# Design Rules

Given that this project is made for and is used by a [Developer Student Clubs](https://g.co/dev/dsc) (DSC) chapter, the following design rules should please be observed/followed while contributing to the project. These rules were gotten from the slide at https://bit.ly/dscbrandingkit which unfortunately, is only available to persons who are DSC Leads. Please if you are not a DSC lead or do not have access to the above slide, just stick to the design rules specified in this file.

## Fonts
* Use Google Sans Bold for headlines.
* Use Google Sans Regular for subheads and body copy.  
* If smaller text is necessary such as for annotations, footnotes, or small labels, please use Roboto Normal. 

#### Note:
Following the above, the full font packages for Google Sans and Roboto were made available in the [resources](./resources) folder. However, just the three mentioned fonts were specified in/imported/used in the web app as of the time this file was created.

## Typography
* Use a ratio of 1½ :1 for setting the size of a header to the body copy. (Example: if your body copy 12pt in size, please set the header to 18 (12/2 = 6; 12+6=18). 
* Use a line spacing of between 1.15-1.5. 
* Add a paragraph break that is ½ the height of the header. (Example: if the header is 24pt in size, add at least a 12pt paragraph break between the header and body copy below.)
* Use color to draw attention to key messages in the typography.
* Left align text and ensure comfortable spacing between lines
* Use the same size for headers and subheaders. Apply Google Sans Regular to the subheaders to create appropriate hierarchy.
* Do not use bold for subheaders or body copy. Reserve bold typography for headers.
* Do not use color for a full body of text. Reserve color usage to the key element of a message that deserves the most attention 
* Do not use highlights or any other typographic treatment for headers. Lean on Google Sans bold and pops of color to draw attention to content when necessary.
* Do not use all caps or underlined text. If you would like to emphasize something, use bold. 
* Do not apply colors outside of the brand guidelines to any typography.
* Do not use italics or adjust the tracking of the text.
