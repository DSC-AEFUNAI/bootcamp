# Design Rules

Given that this project is made for and is used by a [Developer Student Clubs](https://g.co/dev/dsc) (DSC) chapter, the following design rules should please be observed/followed while contributing to the project. These rules were gotten from the slide at https://bit.ly/dscbrandingkit which unfortunately, is only available to persons who are DSC Leads. Please if you are not a DSC lead or do not have access to the above slide, just stick to the design rules specified in this file.

## Fonts
* Use Google Sans Bold for headlines.
* Use Google Sans Regular for subheads and body copy.  
* If smaller text is necessary such as for annotations, footnotes, or small labels, please use Roboto Normal. 

#### Note:
Following the above, the full font packages for Google Sans and Roboto were made available in the [resources](./resources/fonts) folder. However, just the three mentioned fonts were specified in/imported/used in the web app as of the time this file was created.

## Typography
* Use a ratio of 1½ :1 for setting the size of a header to the body copy. (Example: if your body copy 12pt in size, please set the header to 18 (12/2 = 6; 12+6=18). 
* Use a line spacing of between 1.15-1.5. 
* Add a paragraph break that is ½ the height of the header. (Example: if the header is 24pt in size, add at least a 12pt paragraph break between the header and body copy below.)
* Use color to draw attention to key messages in the typography.
* Left align text and ensure comfortable spacing between lines
* Use the same size for headers and subheaders. Apply Google Sans Regular to the subheaders to create appropriate hierarchy.
* Do not use bold for subheaders or body copy. Reserve bold typography for headers.
* Do not use color for a full body of text. Reserve color usage to the key element of a message that deserves the most attention 
* Do not use highlights or any other typographic treatment for headers. Lean on Google Sans bold and pops of color to draw attention to content when necessary.
* Do not use all caps or underlined text. If you would like to emphasize something, use bold. 
* Do not apply colors outside of the brand guidelines to any typography.
* Do not use italics or adjust the tracking of the text.

## Colors
* Use the Google Developers primary color palette in assets or communications.
* White is the most important color in our palette. It provides simplicity and clarity to our visuals, and it’s the foundation of all Google designs, illustrations, and environments. As a core color, White 0 should always be used more than any other color in your composition.
* Use the primary colors to create focus. Pair core colors with neutrals and a white background to bring dimension and focus to an illustration.

#### Note:
The Google Developers primary color palette, made of various shades of blue, red, yellow and green, have been declared as CSS variables in the [core.css](./public/assets/styles/core.css) file (as of the time, this note was written). Also, lighter shades were named 100 and 200 (with 100 being lightest). Darker ones were named 900, 800, 700 and 600 in decreasing order of darkness. The core primary colors, as used in the Google Developers logomark icon (angle brackets with blue, red, yellow and green), were named core in the CSS file.

## Logo
* Use the logo in horizontal and veritcal formats only.
* While the horizontal logo is preferred, the stacked logo can be used as an alternative when space is a limiting factor. 
* The full color logo lockup should only be used on either white and grey backgrounds. 
* The white version should only be used on top of a background color from the Google Developers primary color palette or on photographs that are not too busy.

#### Note:
Colored, white and grey variants of the DSC logo (horizontal and vertical) and Google Developers logomark were all made available in the [resources](./resources/logos) folder. However, a school's logo can easily be generated at https://logo-generator.dscnsec.com/. Meanwhile, colored and white, horizontal and vertical DSC AE-FUNAI logos were also made available in the resources folder too.
