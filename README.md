# Bootcamp

A web app that follows up DSC Members while the take part in bootcamps. Members can check in during each day of the bootcamp, learn from a particular resource being given out, report their progress/assignment by mentors and get ranked on a leaderboard. Mentors can check members' submissions and award marks.

## Implementing
[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) (with indigo as primary and blue as accent colors) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) were used to build this web app. A modified version of the [FirebaseUI-Web](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web) was used for signing-in members. This modified version auto links phone numbers on users without phone numbers.
